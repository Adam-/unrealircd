MetaData / ModuleData technical information (Bram Matthys, 2015)
=================================================================

"MD" stands for module data or meta data and is a system that can be used
to attach data to client, channel or channel membership objects.
The system is extensively documented for developers (module coders) at:
https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Module_Storage

The data is synchronized with other servers (if indicated for that type
of metadata with the sync flag). For instance, the 'certfp' module will
synchronize the SSL Fingerprint of local users with other servers.

Syntax for synchronizing client metadata is as follows (S2S traffic):
:<servername> MD client <nick|uid> <varname> <value>

Example of 'certfp' data:
:maintest.test.net MD client Syzop certfp :1234567890abcdef..etc.

Channel metadata:
:<servername> MD channel <channel> <varname> :<value>

Channel member metadata:
:<servername> MD member <channel> <nick> <varname> :<value>

Channel membership metadata:
:<servername> MD membership <nick> <channel> <varname> :<value>

For more information on the difference of these types see the 
developer documentation mentioned at the beginning of this text.
